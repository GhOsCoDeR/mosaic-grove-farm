The AI didn't actually provide a full replacement for the Navbar.tsx file. Instead, it mentioned that the Navbar.tsx file was in the read-only files and couldn't be directly modified. The AI's approach was to add a CSS override in index.css to target the cart icon rather than modifying the Navbar component directly.

Since there was no full code provided for Navbar.tsx, I cannot provide a complete replacement. The AI's solution was to add this CSS class in index.css:

```css
/* Fix for cart icon color */
.cart-icon-wrapper svg {
  @apply text-mosaic-green-dark !important;
}
```

This assumes that the cart icon in the Navbar is wrapped in an element with the class `cart-icon-wrapper`. Without seeing the actual Navbar.tsx file, I cannot provide the full code with the proper modifications.
